          <p>Hi! my name is <strong>Luis Portillo, Venezuelan Fullstack Web developer</strong>, the only developer involved in this project. In this section you can find general information about this <span className="italic">some kind of</span> App called Relyn, which without further ado, I will explain below...</p>
          <p>I will be as honest possible. I'm not here to show off my amazing skill as a developer or anything like that, just being realistic and critical of my work.</p>
          <p>What can you do here in general? Well... create an account, post things, comment on them, rate them, search for them, follow other users, some customization among other essential things. Of course, there is not much depth in these systems and there are many that are obviously missing but the idea was never to make a social network or something 100% functional in general, it is just a personal learning project, don't forget that.</p>
          <p><strong>A mess, my little beautiful mess</strong>, this is how I would describe this App project, since the initial idea was quite simple development that tried to imitate Reddit posts or something like that, emphasizing learning in the process, but only that.</p>
          <p>For the SPA frontend, I used React (hooks), Redux, Tailwind CSS, among other common libraries and my own implementations.</p>
          <p>For the backend I used TypeScript with ExpressJS, as well as a handful of libraries to perform different tasks and many others that I implemented on my own. Always following the MVC pattern.</p>
          <p>In the case of the database, MongoDB and Mongoose as ORM. The connection to the database is done remotely.</p>
          <p>There are <strong>9</strong> internal routes in the client and another <strong>28</strong> dedicated to the API that supports it.</p>
          <p>There are approximately 5,000 lines of code. There was more time invested than I would like to admit, especially due to poor development conditions and things that I was completely unaware of until then.</p>
          <p>The choice of this technological stack is mainly based on the factor of learning, flexibility and essentially freedom to do my own stuff, and although they fit decently with the initial idea, quickly with the inclusion of new challenges it no longer fit so well, but I decided to keep it since the priority was learning since I have already used "The right tool for the job" before and I simply made limitations one more problem to solve.</p>
          <p>The technology stack used quickly was insufficient and inefficient to cover the increasing features that were added to the initial idea, simply because I thought "Why not?", since that made development more interesting and made it a challenge from which get a lot of benefit based on the experience gained.</p>
          <p>There is a certain layer of security in the client and API especially, everything essential that can be considered according to the needs of this project such as JWT Authentication, CSRF tokens and all kinds of measures and basic considerations in the processes to make everything work in a way safe, at least in theory, since in practice it is the first time that I do these implementations on my own, they will probably work roughly but it is even more likely that there are problems that have escaped my hands due to my lack of experience and I don't even know it yet.</p>
          <p>Some implementations may falter due to my lack of previous experience and which I do not have the time or the intention to correct unfortunately due to the scope of this project as well as other reasons that I explain throughout this document. That said and despite the fact that I made a good attempt, I doubt the effectiveness and reliability of these systems and I strongly recommend not providing sensitive data under any circumstances since its security is not guaranteed and in general many things with the App can break or not behave properly due to its development context and intention of use (Just to test).</p>
          <p>Of course and given the explicit explanation given above, I am not responsible for the damages that the use of this service may generate, you simply go on your own. Although I can guarantee that internally there is no use of data other than the functionality that is desired to be achieved in this App, there may still be many external agents that can maliciously alter said functionality.</p>
          <p>The codebase is not totally free of boilerplate, bugs, things to refactor or optimize (probably) and I am quite aware of most of those problems but in the end it works, almost everything, but the main point is all the knowledge, research, experience and cracks of head that I won and of which I am quite proud. For reasons of time and plans with other projects of a similar purpose (learning) I decided to simply finish as soon as possible to move on to other interesting challenges that I consider myself, even so the final result of this App experiment met and satisfactorily exceeded its objective, being something that I have really enjoyed doing and what I have learned and grown professionally, making me stay awake a few nights for this which is my passion for software development.</p>
          <p>In any case, I hope it will be a pleasant experience for you, user, although there really isn't too much to do around here.
