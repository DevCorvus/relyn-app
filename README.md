A post-based application project developed in Express.js (TypeScript) and React.js

The README ends here because I'm too lazy to explain something I already did a long time ago, you're alone in that jungle of code. Thank you for reading! ❤️

## Context

> NOTE: This is a public update of the project and I want to be brief as I have already written quite a lot of details about this project in the demo, more information below.

This is literally my first project developed and published in Node.js, and second overall. My useful experience prior to this project was about simple HTML/CSS/JS pages, individual technical tests on different sections that I would possibly implement and some common Node.js libraries in addition to a relatively fluent handling of JavaScript (not so much of TypeScript), basics of React.js, TailwindCSS, MongoDB, etc. Basically lots of theory without much practice.

With this foundation, I wanted to get involved in a difficult project, which would serve as learning and practice for all the things I had in mind and thus gain substantial experience.

It took a long time and the result was very satisfactory in terms of its main objective (to learn), but the code itself was quite messy in my opinion at that time (even more so now) and I did not feel particularly comfortable making it public, also because I didn't want to expose potential internal security breaches (which I don't care about now). Also, since I was doing everything on my own and didn't understand the need to mark progress in that context, I only made a commit when it was time to take it to production (facepalm), which is a trend in all my first projects.

This is how I took on the task of making the code slightly more presentable with my current "quality" standards. Most of this effort was focused on refactoring certain parts of the code and updating some dependencies, especially on the backend. The frontend is almost completely intact, on the one hand because I no longer focus on that section and on the other hand because I was quite lazy.

The end result is a mix of old spaghetti code and new spaghetti code, but overall a bit more presentable. Of course there are still a lot of shortcomings and problems but I want to keep relatively intact the essence of a project that I did without much idea, but with which I am quite happy.

You can check, if you are interested, the About page of the demo I wrote back then, where you will find a lot more details that I should have explained here: https://relyn.herokuapp.com/about

Now yes, thanks for reading! ❤️
